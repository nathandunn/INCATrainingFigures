For experiments evaluating the ability of the peptide to directly degrade (p)ppGpp in panel B, the cells were grown as described previously, induced with SHX and allowed to synthesize (p)ppGpp for 3 h prior to peptide treatment. After growth for both A and B, the cells were then diluted 1\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd20 in the same MOPS minimal medium except containing 0.4 mM phosphate (KH2PO4) and 500 \ufffd\ufffdM serine hydroxamate (SHX) to induce (p)ppGpp synthesis, in the presence or absence of peptide 1018 and cells were labelled with 10 \ufffd\ufffdCi/ml 32P for 3 h.

Aliquots of the supernatants were applied to 20\ufffd\ufffd20 cm PEI cellulose TLC plates, resolved with 1.5 M KH2PO4, pH 3.4 for 4 h.

The serological assay (ELISA) demonstrated that TL, VL and CVL individuals showed high levels of antibodies against rPeroxidoxin, allowing identification of infected ones with considerable sensitivity and great ability to discriminate (specificity) between non-infected and CD individuals (98.46% and 100%; 98.18% and 95.71%; 95.79% and 100%, respectively). An rPeroxidoxin ELISA also showed a greater ability to discriminate between vaccinated and infected animals, which is an important requirement for the public campaign control of CVL. A depletion ELISA assay using soluble peptides of this B-cell epitope confirmed the recognition of these sites only by Leishmania-infected individuals. Moreover, this work identifies two antigenic polymorphic linear B-cell epitopes of L. braziliensis. Specific recognition of TL and VL patients was confirmed by significantly decreased IgG reactivity against rPeroxidoxin after depletion of peptide-1- and peptide-2-specific antibodies (peptide 1: reduced by 32%, 42% and 5% for CL, ML and VL, respectively; peptide-2: reduced by 24%, 22% and 13% for CL, ML and VL, respectively) and only peptide-2 for CVL (reduced 9%). Overall, rPeroxidoxin may be a potential antigen for the immunodiagnosis of TL, VL or CVL, as it has a higher agreement with parasitological assays and is better than other reference tests that use soluble Leishmania antigens for diagnosing CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC, Bio-manguinhos, FIOCRUZ)."[39m

For experiments evaluating the ability of the peptide to directly degrade (p)ppGpp in panel B, the cells were grown as described previously, induced with SHX and allowed to synthesize (p)ppGpp for 3 h prior to peptide treatment. After growth for both A and B, the cells were then diluted 1???20 in the same MOPS minimal medium except containing 0.4 mM phosphate (KH2PO4) and 500 ??M serine hydroxamate (SHX) to induce (p)ppGpp synthesis, in the presence or absence of peptide 1018 and cells were labelled with 10 ??Ci/ml 32P for 3 h.

Aliquots of the supernatants were applied to 20??20 cm PEI cellulose TLC plates, resolved with 1.5 M KH2PO4, pH 3.4 for 4 h. After chromatography, nucleotides were visualized by autoradiography and quantified with a MolecularImager FX PhosphorImager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).

The serological assay (ELISA) demonstrated that TL, VL and CVL individuals showed high levels of antibodies against rPeroxidoxin, allowing identification of infected ones with considerable sensitivity and great ability to discriminate (specificity) between non-infected and CD individuals (98.46% and 100%; 98.18% and 95.71%; 95.79% and 100%, respectively). An rPeroxidoxin ELISA also showed a greater ability to discriminate between vaccinated and infected animals, which is an important requirement for the public campaign control of CVL. A depletion ELISA assay using soluble peptides of this B-cell epitope confirmed the recognition of these sites only by Leishmania-infected individuals. Moreover, this work identifies two antigenic polymorphic linear B-cell epitopes of L. braziliensis. Specific recognition of TL and VL patients was confirmed by significantly decreased IgG reactivity against rPeroxidoxin after depletion of peptide-1- and peptide-2-specific antibodies (peptide 1: reduced by 32%, 42% and 5% for CL, ML and VL, respectively; peptide-2: reduced by 24%, 22% and 13% for CL, ML and VL, respectively) and only peptide-2 for CVL (reduced 9%). Overall, rPeroxidoxin may be a potential antigen for the immunodiagnosis of TL, VL or CVL, as it has a higher agreement with parasitological assays and is better than other reference tests that use soluble Leishmania antigens for diagnosing CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC, Bio-manguinhos, FIOCRUZ)."
