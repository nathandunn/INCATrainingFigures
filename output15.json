There were no statistically significant differences by ANOVA (In-Stat3) for all groups and all time points with the exception of some 16 week and 28 week time points, which fit a pattern suggestive of plate-plate variation rather than progressive glomerulosclerosis. For instance, the 16 week KO is significantly lower than the KO at 24 weeks (by ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post test 0.05 for all combinations of 24 week KO versus DH versus ff). It is simply that all 16 week values were atypically low, due either to aberrancy in the ELISA plate or to an unknown confounder at the time of that urine collection. Similarly, the 28 week DH and ff groups are significantly different than the KO 24 week time point (pMyh9 KO mice is not significantly different from control littermates within the same month, and podocyte-specific Myh9 KO mice do not show progressive albuminuria with aging from 8 weeks to 28 weeks."[39m

Thus, PCGF1 complexes, discussed extensively herein, include the additional subunits BCOR and KDM2B. KDM2B has a zinc finger CxxC domain (CXXC) that mediates binding to unmethylated CpG dinucleotides.

In addition, the basal level of complex sphingolipids was significantly higher in Z. bailii than in S. cerevisiae, further emphasizing the proposed link between lipid saturation, high sphingolipid levels and acetic acid tolerance. The results also suggest that acetic acid tolerance is associated with the ability of a given strain to generate large rearrangements in its lipid profile."[39m
