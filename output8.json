Detection of nucleic acids is achieved by padlock probes that are specifically circularized if correctly hybridized to the correct target in the presence of DNA ligase. Padlock and capture probes are added to the samples along with DNA ligase (5 min). Reacted padlock probes are captured on magnetic beads and excess probes are eliminated by washing (3 min). Detection of proteins is initiated by capture of the target protein using magnetic beads equipped with antibodies. The addition of a pair of PLA probes, which are antibodies with attached oligonucleotides (3 min), forms a DNA circle guided by two connector oligonucletides, and a DNA ligase (5 min). Unreacted probes are eliminated by washing the circles, and from this step the magnetic beads are treated identically in both the genetic and PLA assays. A first RCA is initiated either by an extra primer or the target itself on the beads to replicate the DNA circles (11 min). The products are then restriction digested (2 min), and the monomers are collected. The monomers can then bind head-to-tail to the excess amount of replication oligonucleotides and formed new DNA circles. The new circles are amplified and labeled with fluorescence-tagged detection probes. The ligation, amplification and labeling are performed in one reaction (8 min). The RCPs are therefore ready for analysis in the detection instrument."
