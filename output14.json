DEVD is the preferred amino acid sequence of activated caspase 3 and caspase 7 that is linked in between the donor fluorophore, ECFP and acceptor fluorophore, EYFP. If caspases are not activated, when ECFP is excited energy is transferred to EYFP because of the FRET between the donor and acceptor pairs leading to decrease in ECFP fluorescence and increase in EYFP fluorescence. Upon caspase activation, DEVD is cleaved with loss of FRET that changes the ratio of ECFP/EYFP. "
