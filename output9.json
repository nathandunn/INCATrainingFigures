Repair efficiency was assessed by measuring the signal intensities of linearized and digested vector with Bio-Rad Quantity One software using the ???rolling ball??? baseline correction. The signal intensity of the repair bands was divided by the intensity of all three bands. Repair efficiency of unlabeled MutL?? was set at 100 percent and repair of fluorescent tagged MutL?? was determined in relation to the wild-type sample that was expressed, processed and tested in parallel. Average repair values and standard deviations (??) were determined from four independent experiments. Single PMS2 tagged MutL??s, single MLH1-GFP-N tagged MutL??s as well as MLH1-GFP-N coexpressed with PMS2-Red-N or MLH1-Red-N coexpressed with PMS2-GFP-N were MMR proficient while all other tagged variants showed MMR deficiency",
