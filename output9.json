Upon repair of the G-T mismatch to an A-T base pair the intact EcoRV site together with an AseI site gives rise to a 0.8- and a 1.2-kb fragment, whereas unrepaired DNA is only linearized by AseI to a 2-kb fragment. Repair efficiency was assessed by measuring the signal intensities of linearized and digested vector with Bio-Rad Quantity One software using the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdrolling ball\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd baseline correction. The signal intensity of the repair bands was divided by the intensity of all three bands. Repair efficiency of unlabeled MutL\ufffd\ufffd was set at 100 percent and repair of fluorescent tagged MutL\ufffd\ufffd was determined in relation to the wild-type sample that was expressed, processed and tested in parallel. Average repair values and standard deviations (\ufffd\ufffd) were determined from four independent experiments. Single PMS2 tagged MutL\ufffd\ufffds, single MLH1-GFP-N tagged MutL\ufffd\ufffds as well as MLH1-GFP-N coexpressed with PMS2-Red-N or MLH1-Red-N coexpressed with PMS2-GFP-N were MMR proficient while all other tagged variants showed MMR deficiency"[39m,

          "[10]. In vitro repair was scored on a 2-kb circular DNA substrate that contains an EcoRV site which is destroyed by a G-T mismatch. Upon repair of the G-T mismatch to an A-T base pair the intact EcoRV site together with an AseI site gives rise to a 0.8- and a 1.2-kb fragment, whereas unrepaired DNA is only linearized by AseI to a 2-kb fragment. Repair efficiency was assessed by measuring the signal intensities of linearized and digested vector with Bio-Rad Quantity One software using the ???rolling ball??? baseline correction. The signal intensity of the repair bands was divided by the intensity of all three bands. Repair efficiency of unlabeled MutL?? was set at 100 percent and repair of fluorescent tagged MutL?? was determined in relation to the wild-type sample that was expressed, processed and tested in parallel. Average repair values and standard deviations (??) were determined from four independent experiments. Single PMS2 tagged MutL??s, single MLH1-GFP-N tagged MutL??s as well as MLH1-GFP-N coexpressed with PMS2-Red-N or MLH1-Red-N coexpressed with PMS2-GFP-N were MMR proficient while all other tagged variants showed MMR deficiency",
