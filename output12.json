In particular, the synthetic networks generated by this model configuration replicated the characteristic differences found in the real brain networks, with EO eliciting significantly higher segregation in the alpha frequency band (8\u201313\u2009Hz) as compared to EC. Furthermore, the fitted ERGM parameter values provided complementary information showing that clustering connections are significantly more represented from EC to EO in the alpha range, but also in the beta band (14\u201329\u2009Hz), which is known to play a crucial role in cortical processing of visual input and externally oriented attention. Taken together, these findings support the current view of the brain functional segregation and integration in terms of modules and hubs, and provide a statistical approach to extract new information on the (re)organizational mechanisms in healthy and diseased brains."[39m

Results showed that the tendency to form triangles and stars, reflecting clustering and node centrality, better explained the global properties of the EEG connectomes as compared to other combinations of graph metrics. In particular, the synthetic networks generated by this model configuration replicated the characteristic differences found in the real brain networks, with EO eliciting significantly higher segregation in the alpha frequency band (8\u201313\u2009Hz) as compared to EC. Furthermore, the fitted ERGM parameter values provided complementary information showing that clustering connections are significantly more represented from EC to EO in the alpha range, but also in the beta band (14\u201329\u2009Hz), which is known to play a crucial role in cortical processing of visual input and externally oriented attention. Taken together, these findings support the current view of the brain functional segregation and integration in terms of modules and hubs, and provide a statistical approach to extract new information on the (re)organizational mechanisms in healthy and diseased brains."
