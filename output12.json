Results showed that the tendency to form triangles and stars, reflecting clustering and node centrality, better explained the global properties of the EEG connectomes as compared to other combinations of graph metrics. In particular, the synthetic networks generated by this model configuration replicated the characteristic differences found in the real brain networks, with EO eliciting significantly higher segregation in the alpha frequency band (8\u201313\u2009Hz) as compared to EC. Furthermore, the fitted ERGM parameter values provided complementary information showing that clustering connections are significantly more represented from EC to EO in the alpha range, but also in the beta band (14\u201329\u2009Hz), which is known to play a crucial role in cortical processing of visual input and externally oriented attention. Taken together, these findings support the current view of the brain functional segregation and integration in terms of modules and hubs, and provide a statistical approach to extract new information on the (re)organizational mechanisms in healthy and diseased brains."

          "(C) CD1d expression by B and T cells in the spleen. In C57BL/6 mice, CD1d was analyzed with the biotinylated WTH-2 mAb followed by SA-PE and in LEW rats, since biotinylated mAbs were used for B and T cell identification, CD1d was stained with unconjugated WTH-2 mAb followed by PE-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG. Filled histograms are control stainings carried out as WTH-2 stainings but with an isotype control antibody. (Upper row) Relative CD1d expression by B and T cells. Histograms show separate multicolor experiments with same overall CD1d staining intensity (Fig. S2), since both, T and B cells, were identified using APCy visualized antibodies in order to avoid unspecific signal due to fluorescence spectral overlap into the PE channel. The gating strategy and the antibodies used are explained in detail in figure S2. Gray and black lines correspond to B and T cells, respectively. (Lower row) Histograms show CD1d expression by CD4 and CD8 positive T cells. The gating strategy and used antibodies are explained in detail in the figure S3. Gray and black lines represent CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively."
