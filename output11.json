The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation and estimated as above. The results show that the presence of several peptides in low concentration is sufficient to induce lens crystallin precipitation when the crystallin concentration is high. Therefore, an in vivo lens protein concentration of 400 mg/ml is likely to aggregate and precipitate even when the peptide concentration is 100's of times lower than that of crystallins."
