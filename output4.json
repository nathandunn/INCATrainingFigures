The +FF and ?FF subgroups display differently-shaped force profiles but similar overall force levels during training, corresponding to similar average endpoint errors (not shown). The ?FF subgroup data are well-captured by the adaptation coefficient measure (black line), which is a regression onto the ideal force profile, while the +FF data are not. This explains why learning and decay appear attenuated in the +FF subgroup in Fig 3. We performed a control experiment consisting of a 0-FF \u201ctraining\u201d block and a zEC retention block (experiment 3) to provide a baseline reference for adaptation and decay. Considering the force profiles (colored traces in top row) relative to this baseline reference (gray traces in top row) reveals symmetric adaptation and decay between +FF and ?FF conditions for both training and retention (colored traces in second row). Note that the control experiment force profiles increase substantially during the retention period, indicating that the unreferenced shooting movement decay data in Fig 3 are confounded by a tendency to produce more positive force during an extended EC block. Without control-referencing, this tendency causes the +FF decay to be underestimated and the ?FF decay to be overestimated, as it was in Fig 3. Since the control-referenced retention data is still not always well explained by the shape of the adaptation coefficient measure, we quantified adaptation using an integrated lateral force measure that is agnostic to the shape of the force profile.

The amount of RpoAint at each time point was then divided by the amount of RpoAint at time 0 as follows: relative ratio (RpoAint (X hour)) = [normalized signal intensity of RpoAint (X hour)] / [normalized signal intensity of RpoAint (0 hour)]. The orange line represents the relative ratios of RpoAint in the RNAP complexes of rpoAdel-expressing cells at each time point, calculated as described above. The black line shows the relative ratios of the amount of RpoAdel in the RNAP complexes of rpoAdel-expressing cells at each time point against to the amount of RpoAdel at 6 hours after the beginning of the RpoAdel induction.

The +FF and ?FF subgroups display differently-shaped force profiles but similar overall force levels during training, corresponding to similar average endpoint errors (not shown). The ?FF subgroup data are well-captured by the adaptation coefficient measure (black line), which is a regression onto the ideal force profile, while the +FF data are not. This explains why learning and decay appear attenuated in the +FF subgroup in Fig 3. We performed a control experiment consisting of a 0-FF \u201ctraining\u201d block and a zEC retention block (experiment 3) to provide a baseline reference for adaptation and decay. Considering the force profiles (colored traces in top row) relative to this baseline reference (gray traces in top row) reveals symmetric adaptation and decay between +FF and ?FF conditions for both training and retention (colored traces in second row). Note that the control experiment force profiles increase substantially during the retention period, indicating that the unreferenced shooting movement decay data in Fig 3 are confounded by a tendency to produce more positive force during an extended EC block. Without control-referencing, this tendency causes the +FF decay to be underestimated and the ?FF decay to be overestimated, as it was in Fig 3. Since the control-referenced retention data is still not always well explained by the shape of the adaptation coefficient measure, we quantified adaptation using an integrated lateral force measure that is agnostic to the shape of the force profile.
